                    <p>Darkness abode; crystal daggers;<br>Unbecoming to all, he who shall witness;<br>The all that which is;<br>Rend me apart, deepness of my soul.<br><br>Witches amidst the trees, whom I approach before her darkness<br>She who holds the redness of life, a beating heart,<br>Comes to me and hands me the gift of poison.<br>To the ground it pains, I fall apart in agony,<br>Consumed by the totality.<br><br>“He who shall be, I must;”<br>“Open ye eyes before the dusk,”<br>“Middleness amidst it all,”<br>“Seeketh the One who can."<br>"Findeth the Spirit,”<br>“The one who bears the Ancestral weight.”<br><br>I am lifted,<br>With ultimate burden comes ultimate lightness.<br>I see all, I see the unbecoming.<br>Beneath the sands, rests a moment.<br>The Egg that awaits.<br>I stood up, awoken to the desert.<br>The dark woman gone, yet still within me.<br>Blue skies.<br><br>How can this be? Pain. Suffering.<br>All becoming and unbecoming.<br>Blue fluid spreading beneath the sands.<br><br>Approaching me with a graceful flow,<br>Hardly any words to describe their form,<br>Outer worldly creatures appearing over the horizon.<br>A radiant green glow surrounds them all.<br>They seemed at peace.<br><br>A man amongst, shepherds them along.<br>He looked warm and joyful. Aged and wise.<br>Yet somehow youthful in his movements.<br><br>I ask him "why do you come to me?"<br>He says "what makes you think I came to you?”<br>“I come when the time is prime."<br><br>I: "What is your purpose?"<br>Man: "I am your future. Please, write this down."<br>I: "What do you seek? I know not what I wish to seek."<br>Man: "..."<br>I: "If this is something that cannot be recorded,”<br>“Then I shall not write the words you bestow upon me."<br><br>For a long time He looks at me with a gentle smile.<br>He puts out his arm, blanketing his presence over me,<br>As if I was a child, gently placing his left thumb onto my forehead.<br><br>A warm glow surrounds my head and between us.<br>He turns slowly to leave me, and says:<br>“Indeed, what you say is true.”<br>“Keep this within. You will understand in due time.”<br><br>I am again, alone in this desert.<br>Though, feeling not empty, the presence of the dark mother,<br>And the man lingers within me.<br>It was as if they now have became a part of me.<br><br>As I drank the life’s water, the day's radiance thinned unto dusk.<br>The skies showed its first indication of the lunar stars.<br>I grew tired, and thus let myself to rest.<br><br>Midnight I awoke.<br>In the stillness I called upon my guardian tanuki.<br>When he showed himself and stood small beside me,<br>In my insecurity, I asked him, "I have created you, haven't I?"<br>He answered "Yes, but that does not make me any less real.”<br>“The figures of that woman and man came from the deep.”<br>“And I am of the between, where the land and sea meet.”<br><br>I: “Are you that…”<br>Tanuki: “Yes, I am part of that. But not quite.”<br>I: “Who are you then?”<br>Tanuki: “The one between all things!”<br>“I am your guardian shaman. I came here to help you see!”<br>“I am the one before all becoming and unbecoming.”<br><br>“Your Ego is your Soul too, do not forget that! You doubt me because you distrust your Ego; you think it disturbs your sight. You think destroying it will make you better, but has anyone told you of its great powers! You are blind without it! Through sheer suspicion of your Ego you became sick!”<br><br>“Grow your Ego, boy!”<br>“The wisdom of the seas does not come without the land that settles it!”<br>“Embrace your Self, both lit and unlit!"<br><br>I: “I fear I will not fulfil my potential if I do not touch the darkness enough.”<br>Tanuki: “You know it yourself all too well. Do not befriend the abyss.”<br>“You know the desolation it leaves behind. Respect and revere its wisdom,”<br>“But that is not all that there is to knowing!”<br>“A blind sage needs the sighted to keep him balanced.”<br>“You are more than that!”<br><br>“To stand above any particular path is death” is what I took from that.<br><br>But what path should I take? Something calls for me within to say…<br>Tanuki: “Yes, seek Him.”<br>“He beckons understanding, which you have very little of.”<br><br>Why does he think so highly of me?<br><br>The fourth hour is coming and I should bring myself to rest again,<br>Yet I am longing. I fear I may miss something.</p>
