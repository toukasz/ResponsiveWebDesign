				<h3>Appearance:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Faceless Mask: The Digi-Noppera-bō has a smooth, featureless face, symbolizing the loss of personal identity in the vast digital landscape.</li>
					<li>Flickering Aura: Surrounded by a glow reminiscent of screen light, its form occasionally glitches, mimicking the errors and buffering of a poor internet connection.</li>
					<li>Wired Body: Its limbs appear like tangled wires and cables, constantly shifting and intertwining, representing our entanglement with technology.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Origin:</h3>
				<p>Born from the collective consciousness of a hyper-connected world, the Digi-Noppera-bō is a manifestation of our dependence on digital devices and the internet. It haunts social media platforms, chat rooms, and forums, feeding off the energy of endless scrolling and the search for validation through likes and shares.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Habitat:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Virtual Spaces: Found lurking in the comment sections, anonymous forums, and behind avatars on social media.</li>
					<li>Modern Urban Areas: In cities filled with screens and digital billboards, it wanders, invisible to those engrossed in their devices.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Behavior:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Mimicry: The Digi-Noppera-bō often mimics the voices and writing styles of others, creating confusion and spreading misinformation.</li>
					<li>Energy Drain: It feeds on the time and emotional energy people invest in their digital lives, leaving them feeling exhausted and disconnected.</li>
					<li>Ephemeral Presence: Like a fleeting notification, it appears and disappears, leaving only a vague sense of unease and emptiness.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Symbols:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Glowing Screen: A symbol of both enlightenment and entrapment, representing the dual nature of the digital age.</li>
					<li>Endless Scroll: A reminder of the unending pursuit of content and connection, often leading nowhere.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>How to Ward Off:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Digital Detox: Taking breaks from screens and reconnecting with the physical world can weaken the yōkai’s influence.</li>
					<li>Mindfulness: Being aware of one’s digital consumption and engaging purposefully rather than mindlessly can diminish its power.</li>
					<li>Community: Building real-life connections and engaging in face-to-face interactions can dispel the isolating aura of the Digi-Noppera-bō.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

				<h3>Legend:</h3>
				<p>It is said that those who fall too deeply into the digital realm without balance may catch a glimpse of the Digi-Noppera-bō, reminding them to reclaim their face—their identity—and reconnect with the world beyond the screen.</p>

			<h2>Embrace the Balance</h2>
			<p>In an era where technology is inextricable from daily life, the Digi-Noppera-bō serves as a cautionary tale of losing oneself to the faceless void of the digital world. By acknowledging its presence and taking steps to maintain our individuality and humanity, we can navigate the digital age without losing our essence.</p>
